    "This project explores the relationship between advanced golf statistics and player success on the PGA Tour. By analyzing data from multiple seasons, I aimed to identify key performance indicators that contribute to a golfer's success. The data came from [PGA Tour's database](https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html) and includes various advanced metrics: strokes gained (summed and individual), driving accuracy, driving distance, and greens in regulation. Through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, I manipulated the dataset to represent the strength in correlation between these advanced stats and two success metrics: money earned and scoring average."
