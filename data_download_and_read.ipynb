    "The PGA TOUR collects its data through automated tracking and manual entry of every shot taken by every golfer in every tournament during a given season. This data is then used to calculate various advanced statistics, such as strokes gained metrics, greens in regulation, and scoring average. Additionally, advanced shot tracking technology, such as ShotLink, is used to collect data on shot distances, accuracy, proximity, and other factors that contribute to a golfer's performance on the course. Finally, FedEx ranking and money earned data is collected based on a golfer's placement in tournaments throughout the season. All this data is compiled and made publicly available to inspect and download through the PGA TOUR website."

    "### Definition of Each Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The PGA TOUR defines the Strokes Gained (SG) metric as a golf statistic that measures a golfer's performance for a specific shot by comparing it to the average number of strokes it takes other players to complete the hole from that same position. A positive SG value indicates that the golfer took more strokes than the average player to complete the hole from that position (performing worse), while a negative SG value indicates that the golfer took fewer strokes than the average player from that position (performing better). The SG metric can be used to evaluate a golfer's performance compared to the field average for a given shot type. This is done using the following sub-metrics defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strokes Gained Off-the-Tee (SG: OTT): Measures a golfer's tee shot performance on Par 4s and Par 5s, comparing how far they  advance the ball versus the field average from that distance/lie. Ultimately, reflecting how much their driving helps or hurts their scoring opportunities compared to the field average.\n",
    "- Strokes Gained on Approach (SG: APP): Measures a golfer's performance on shots from the fairway/rough that are further than 30 yards from the flag, measuring accuracy into greens. Ultimately, reflecting how much their approach shots outside of 30 yards help or hurt their scoring opportunities compared to the field average.\n",
    "- Strokes Gained Around-the-Green (SG: ARG): Shots within about 30 yards of the green, but not on the putting surface, for example, chipping, pitching, and bunker shots. Ultimately, reflecting how much their short game around the green helps or hurts their scoring opportunities compared to the field average.\n",
    "- Strokes Gained Putting (SG: PUT): Compares putting performance from your initial distances to the hole, while on the green, against the field average for those same putts. Ultimately, reflecting how much their putting helps or hurts their scoring opportunities compared to the field average.\n",
    "- Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green (SG: T2G): All shots from the tee box until the ball is on the green, showing overall long-game skill. This is just the sum of SG: OTT, SG: APP, and SG: ARG. Ultimately, reflecting how much their long game (driving, approach, and short game) helps or hurts their scoring opportunities compared to the field average.\n",
    "- Strokes Gained Total (SG: TOT): The sum of all strokes gained shots, including putting. This is just the sum of SG: T2G and SG: PUT. Ultimately, reflecting how much their overall game (long game and putting) helps or hurts their scoring opportunities compared to the field average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Statistics:\n",
    "- Driving Distance: Average distance (in yards) a golfer hits the ball off the tee on Par 4s and Par 5s.\n",
    "- Driving Accuracy: Percentage of times a golfer's tee shot on Par 4s and Par 5s lands in the fairway.\n",
    "- Scoring Average: Average number of strokes a golfer takes per round. (Success Metric)\n",
    "- Money Earned: Total prize money a golfer has earned in a season (in USD). (Success Metric)\n",
    "- FedEx Rank: A points-based ranking system used to determine the top players on the PGA TOUR throughout a given season. (Success Metric)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Features\n",
    "Run the following cells to see the features of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The dataset is made up of the following columns:\n",
    "- year: The year of the season (integer)\n",

    "- sg_off_the_tee: Strokes Gained: Off the Tee (float)\n",
